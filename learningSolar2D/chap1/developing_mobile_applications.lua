DEVELOPING MOBILE APPLICATIONS

From concept to store, an app development project goes through eight distinct stages:

  1.DESIGN PHASE: This is the entry proint that many apps never get past; I have an
    idea for an app and what I want the app to do. The first to determine is if the
    device I hope to place the app on can even do the tasks that I require of it. If
    it can, is the project feasible? There are many considerations including 
    development costs, software costs, web hosing expenses, and dev time.
    
    Creating a good design document is critical. If the project appears to be capable
    of being completed, then I move on to the next stage. I need to remember to
    include in this initial design phase how to make money from my app and include
    any social networking/marking ideas.

    The most successful apps plan for marketing and sales from the beginning. One
    final consideration in the design phase is legal. I need to be sure to investigate
    the intellectual property and regional/national laws where I plan to sell my app.

  2.GATHER REQUIREMENTS: This phase details exactly what functionality the app will
    contain and the design of what the various views will look like. Many people
    use tools like Figma for layout. This is an essential phase. If I, the developer,
    am unsure of what the app will look like when its completed, how can I communicate
    what I am developing to others? I need to be sure to keep these initial designs
    and develop a webpage around the development process. It will help with the 
    marketing efforts in the end.

  3.CODE AND GRAPHIC DEVELOPMENT: This is where we finally get started programming
    and developing the graphics for my project. The best teams are composed of 
    programmers AND artists.

  4.USER TESTING: Too many people skip the testing phase or don't conduct a 
    thorough testing of their app. I'll need to deploy my app to a few test
    devices and have people in my target audience use the app. I must listen
    to their feedback (remembering that they might be overly kind) and implement
    their suggestions (if they aren't stupid 🤔)

  5.SYSTEM TESTS: Before releasing my app into the wild, I need to run system
    tests. Is my app connecting to a remote server, the cloud, Facebook, X/Twitter,
    or TikTok? I need to make sure that all of these features and services are
    capable of supporting the additional demand my app might place on it.
  
  6.DOCUMENTING AND MARKETING: Before I can relase my work to an app store, I must
    have a supporting webpage in place with contact emails and screenshots. This
    is also part of my marketing effort, so its good to ensure everything is in
    place and perfect.

  7.PRODUCTION: I then create my app for release and place it in the stores where
    I want to sell it.

  8.MAINTENANCE: If I haven't noticed, the operating systems for devices are constantly
    changing with more, newer devices becoming available on almost a regular basis.
    I should expect to refresh and update my app every few months at the 
    very least. On the bright side, in most app stores, releasing a new version could
    get me a higher ranking in the search engine!
