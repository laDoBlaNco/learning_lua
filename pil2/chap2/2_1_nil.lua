2.1 - NIL
Nil is aa type with a single value, nil, whosemain property is to be different from any
other value in lua. As I've seen, a global var has a nil value by default, before its 
assignment, and I can assign nil to a global var to delete it. Lua uses nil as a kind of 
non-value, to represent the absence of a useful value
