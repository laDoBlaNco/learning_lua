Overview:

This chapter will reach me how to use the lapis framework, finally. This is the reason I'm even 
studying this book to replace my php knowledge with lua web dev knowledge. The lapis framework
is a powerful tool for making dynamic  web apps that was built on lua. It will teach me how to 
quickly set up lapis in a linux environment and give me a chance to sue its powerful features.
Next, I'll find out about some of the most important parts of lapis development, such as routing, 
URL mapping, and how to render templates. I'll also see how to set up routes that connect certain
URLs to lua functions. This let's me respond to web requests in a dynamic way. I'll learn how
to make and manage templates that separate presentation from business logic. This will keep the 
code clean and easy to maintain.

Lastly, I'll look at managing sessions, integrating middleware, and putting lapis apps into use.
All the stuff I learned how to do from hacking with PHP. I'll be taught to set up sessions for 
managing sessions and authenticating users. This will keep user data safe across multiple requests.
Additional features, like logging and data validation, will be added by adding middleware
components. I'll find out about deployment strategies that'll help me move my apps from a dev
environment to production. I'll learn how to build, secure, and deploy strong web apps using
the lapis framework by studying these topics.

Up and Running with Lapis Framework
Lapis Framework Overview:

Lapis is an awesome web development framework built on lua that makes it super easy to create
dynamic, high-performance web applications. Lapis is all about making the most of lua's 
simplicity and effeciency, giving me an organzied structure and a syntax that's a breeze to
use for building web applications.

Lapis is built to work seamlessly with lua's lightweight nature. Its design focuses on modularity,
allowing me to organize my code into logical sections such as controllers, models, and views.
The framework provides a clear structure: 
▫️ the app directory houses our application logic (controllers and models) 
▫️ the views directory contains our templates for rendering HTML responses
▫️ the config directory holds the configuration settings which include options for routing,
    database connections, and environment specific settings. 
This clean separation of concerns enables me to build maintainable, scalabale web applications
and makes it easier  to collaberate with other developers.

Lapis provides a range of built-in features that simplify common web development tasks. it offers
an intuitive routing system that maps URLs to specific lua functions, making it simple to handle
different HTTP requests. Additionally, lapis includes a robust template engine that will allow me
to generate dynamic HTML content by combining lua logic with pre-designed templates. Its built-in
support for session management and middleware integration means I can manage user sessions, 
authentication, and logging without relying on external libraries. These features come together
to streamline the development process, leting me focus on writing my application's unique functionality
rather than reinventing standard web components.
