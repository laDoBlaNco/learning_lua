-- if the embedded script contains a syntax error, executing it to dofile will cause an error
-- To manage this, we can again use pcall to catch the error before it its your overall
-- application
local status, err = pcall(function()
  dofile('embedded_script_with_syntax_error.lua')
end)

if not status then
  print('Syntax error in embedded script:',err)
  -- fallback: alert the dev or load a corrected version of the script

Best practices for dealing with self integration and errors

To ensure a smooth integration of lua scripts into or applications, consider the following
practices:
▫️ Always wrap script execution in pcall or similar mechanisms to catch errors
▫️ Validate file existence and paths before loading
▫️ Use logging functions to record errors with detailed messages and timestamps
▫️ Design fallback stategies, such as default configurations or alternative workflows, to 
   maintain application stability
▫️ When embedding scripts from external sources, sanitize input and verify that the script
   content meets security standards.
