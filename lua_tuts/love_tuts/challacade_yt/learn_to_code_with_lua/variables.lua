--Variables - a variable is a named place to stare data, whose value can be changed.

local message = 'lua is awesome' -- the var is 'message' and the value is the text (string)
local message2 = 5               -- variables can also hold numbers
local chicken = 10
local result = chicken / 20       -- this could change and we can do math
chicken = chicken + 10

print()
print(message)
print(message2)
print(chicken)
print(result)
