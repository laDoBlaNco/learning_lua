--[[
This section of the reference describes the lexis, the syntax, and the sematnics of lua.
In other words, this section describes which tokens are valid, how they can be combined, and
what their combinations mean. 

The language constrcuts will be explaine using the usual extended BnF notation, in which
{a} means 00 or more a's and [a] means an optional a. Non-terminals are shown like non-terminal
keywords are showing like kword, and other terminal symbols are showing like '='. The complete
syntax of lua can be found in at the end of this manual.
