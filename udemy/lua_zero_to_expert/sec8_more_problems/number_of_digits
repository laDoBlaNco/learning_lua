SECTION 8 - PROBLEM 3 - NUMBER OF DIGITS

Write a function in lua that receives a number and prints its number of digits
using algorithm of counting how many times we can divide the number by 10, we get the
number of digits. The instructore is using math.floor to get to  zero and use 'while temp > 0',
but in reality I can just use while temp > 1 and get the same. Actually after seeing it through, I
see why we need to do the math.floor. Since the number can be 0, I can't use 'while temp > 1'
]]

function digits(n)
  local count = 0
  local temp = n
  if temp == 0 then
    count = 1
  else
    while temp > 0 do
      temp = math.floor(temp / 10)
      count = count + 1
    end
  end
  print(string.format("The number of digits of %d is %d", n, count))
  -- print("The number of digits of " .. n .. " is " .. count .. ".")
end

digits(7)
digits(12345)
digits(0)
